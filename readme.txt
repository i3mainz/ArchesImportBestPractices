Importing legacy data into Arches – Best Practices

ArchesImportBestPractices.doc/pdf describes how project specific legacy data can be imported into Arches. The examples are based on a use case that is currently being implemented at the i3mainz – Institute for Spatial Information and Surveying Technology: In course of a joint research project the i3mainz and the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz (RGZM) work on an archaeological information system serving for complex landscape-based settlement structure analyses. In the past decade a series of heterogeneous datasets of the West-Central European Neolithic have been generated through numerous MA-theses, dissertations and research projects. Given this background this document addresses the tasks arising when integrating legacy data and the models they are based upon into Arches, rather than the task to build up an inventory from scratch.
